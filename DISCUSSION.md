Thanks for your time and consideration. First time using some of these libs, but I'm a fan now.

### Some things I would want to look at more:

- Search:

  - Debounce search so that people can get relevant results as they type after a few characters or so.
  - Clear search function

- Data: Look at ways to better organize the data, perhaps by location, etc in order to make queries more efficient. Also, I messed it up towards the end when looking at updating some of the schema names, initialization of db, etc.

- Responsiveness: I care about how things look as well. I spent a little too much time here, should have put more into the API/data.

- Test: Add e2e and component cypress tests to ensure they work as expected.

I'm sure there's more I could do of course. Overall, thanks again and would love to talk more.

Best,

Troy
